Dear Karl Sjöstrand

I have pleasure in enclosing your UID prefix as promised.  It is:

1.2.826.0.1.3680043.9.5081.

You are hereby granted full permission to use this UID prefix as your own subject only to the following minimal conditions:

1) You agree to operate a policy to ensure that UIDs subordinate to this prefix cannot be duplicated.

2) You may sub-delegate ranges using your prefix, providing this is either on a not-for-profit basis, or as part of another product.
     i.e. you may not sell numbering space itself

I hope that this facility is useful to you, but if you have any questions, please ask.

Yours sincerely

David Harvey
